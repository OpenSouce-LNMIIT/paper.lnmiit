**Adding a new paper guidelines**

 1. Make sure the paper is in PDF format. 
 2. Rename the paper to format Y1_ENG, here Y1 is for the year (Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4) and first 3 letters of the course.
 3. Clone the repo and add the file to the correct directory. 
    Y1_ENG shall go to for ex. year1/sem1. directory
 4. Branch specific subjects shall go into respective branch folders. If a subject is common for multiple branches, don't add    it in every folder. Add it in any one of the branches and use that link for all.
 5. Make changes in the HTML file for the subject(s) in correct semester and branch(s). 
 6. Make a Pull Request!
